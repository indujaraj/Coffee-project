                    <p>So, who was the lucky soul to first get to drink coffee? We'll probably never know for sure, but
                        legends
                        attribute the discovery to a goat herder named Kaldi. Kaldi lived in the central highlands of
                        Ethiopia,
                        the native home of the coffee plant, possibly as early as the 6th century CE. According to
                        tradition, he
                        noticed that when his goats ate the red, cherry-like fruit of a certain plant, they became
                        really
                        energized and wouldn't sleep at night. So, he tried the fruit himself and experienced a similar
                        effect.
                        As a reminder, this was a world before caffeine was a major part of people's lives, so we can
                        only
                        imagine what Kaldi's first experience with it must have felt like. Apparently, he enjoyed it and
                        showed
                        a local abbot. That abbot realized that the fruit helped him stay awake during evening prayers,
                        and
                        shared it around the monastery. Word of this amazing fruit spread quickly across northeast
                        Africa and
                        into the Arabian Peninsula, where it became a dietary staple.
